It's important to understand that pinpointing exact, definitive "top 10" lists of cloud breaches is difficult, as many incidents go unreported or are only partially disclosed. However, I can provide you with a summary of significant recent cloud-related cybersecurity incidents and trends, highlighting the key vulnerabilities exploited:
Here are some recent cloud related cyber attacks and data breaches:
•	Snowflake Customer Data Breaches (2024): 
o	This incident involved breaches of several Snowflake customers, including Ticketmaster. Attackers used stolen credentials to access customer data stored in Snowflake's cloud data platform. This highlights the risk of credential theft and the importance of strong access controls.
•	Microsoft (Midnight Blizzard): 
o	Russian APT Midnight Blizzard gained access to Microsoft's corporate Office 365 environment, compromising emails of executives and cybersecurity staff. This breach underscores the persistent threat of nation-state actors targeting cloud environments and the importance of robust identity and access management.
•	Ivanti VPN Attacks: 
o	Exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs led to widespread compromise of devices, including those used by critical infrastructure providers. This demonstrates the risk of vulnerabilities in network devices that provide access to cloud resources.
•	Attacks on SOHO Routers: 
o	The FBI reported that China-linked and Russia-linked threat groups compromised numerous small office/home office (SOHO) routers to create botnets for potential attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure. This highlights the growing risk of attacks on edge devices that connect to cloud services.
•	Change Healthcare Ransomware Attack (2024): 
o	This incident, while impacting a wide variety of systems, involved cloud based systems, and caused massive disruption to the healthcare sector. Ransomware attacks continue to be a major threat to cloud environments.
•	Data breaches due to cloud misconfigurations: 
o	Many companies have experienced data leaks due to simple misconfigurations in cloud storage services like Amazon S3 buckets. These incidents highlight the importance of proper cloud security posture management.
•	API related data breaches: 
o	With the increased use of API's, many attackers are now targeting those interfaces to exfiltrate data. This is an increasing trend.
•	Increased attacks on cloud based Identity and Access Management (IAM): 
o	Attackers are increasingly targeting IAM systems to gain access to cloud resources.
•	Phishing attacks targeting cloud credentials: 
o	Phishing remains a highly effective attack vector, with attackers targeting cloud credentials to gain unauthorized access.
•	Supply chain attacks that leverage cloud services: 
o	Attackers are increasingly targeting vulnerabilities in software supply chains to insert malicious code into cloud-based applications.
Key Cloud Security Takeaways:
•	Credential security is paramount: Stolen credentials are a common entry point for cloud breaches.
•	Cloud misconfigurations are a major risk: Proper configuration of cloud services is essential.
•	API security is critical: APIs must be secured to prevent unauthorized access.
•	Zero-day vulnerabilities pose a significant threat: Organizations must be prepared to respond to emerging threats.
•	IAM is a crucial security control: Robust IAM policies and procedures are essential.
I hope this information is helpful.

Snowflake
Okay, let's delve into the more specific and "real" information regarding the Snowflake customer data breaches of 2024, focusing on key details that have emerged:
Key Real-World Details:
•	Threat Actor: 
o	The attacks are linked to a financially motivated threat actor group known as UNC5537, also connected to the "Scattered Spider" group.
•	Attack Vector: 
o	The primary attack vector was the use of stolen credentials, obtained through infostealer malware.
o	Infostealer malware variants including VIDAR, RISEPRO, REDLINE, RACOON STEALER, LUMMA and METASTEALER were used to harvest credentials from user devices.
•	Lack of MFA: 
o	A critical factor in the success of the attacks was the lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) on many compromised Snowflake customer accounts.
•	Targeted Data: 
o	The attackers targeted sensitive customer data stored within Snowflake's cloud data platform.
o	Compromised data included personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, and other sensitive information.
•	Impacted Companies: 
o	Notable victims include: 
	Ticketmaster
	Santander Bank
	AT&T
	Advance Auto Parts.
•	Data Exfiltration: 
o	Attackers used SQL commands to exfiltrate data from compromised Snowflake instances.
o	The "Rapeflake" tool was used to collect data.
o	Client Application IDs were used in the exfiltration process.
•	Extortion: 
o	Attackers engaged in extortion, demanding ransom payments from affected companies to prevent the public release of stolen data.
•	Credential Sources: 
o	Compromised credentials were found in infostealer malware logs and on dark web marketplaces.
•	Mandiant's Role: 
o	Cybersecurity firm Mandiant played a key role in investigating the attacks and identifying the threat actor group.
o	Mandiant pointed to the compromise of 3rd party contractor accounts as a source of credential compromise.
•	Scale of Impact: 
o	The attacks affected a large number of Snowflake customers, highlighting the widespread vulnerability to credential theft in cloud environments.
These bullet points provide a more detailed and accurate picture of the Snowflake customer data breaches, emphasizing the specific tactics and actors involved.
